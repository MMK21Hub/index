## üîÆ Meta

- [MMK21Hub/MMK21Hub](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/MMK21Hub) - A special repository that contains my personal README file, which is visible [at the top of my profile](https://github.com/MMK21Hub#mmk21)

## üç¥ Forks

- [t-rex-runner-black](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/t-rex-runner-black) - A dark-themed fork of [wayou/t-rex-runner](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner), which is itself extracted from [Chromium source code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/neterror/resources/offline.js;l=7?q=t-rex%20package:%5Echromium$&ss=chromium).
- [XHAK](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) - A fork of [XAHK](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) (apparently called Minescript now?), which was the Minecraft autoclicker AutoHotKey script commissioned by Xisumavoid. At time of forking, it looked like development had ceased. However, the original script has since had features added and new releases published, meaning that this fork is now out-of-date.
- [notable-customizations](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/notable-customizations) - A fork of [Notable Customizations](https://github.com/notable/notable-customizations), a list of community-made customizations to the Notable note-taking app. It includes some of my own custom CSS and shortcuts.
- [BlingEdit-1](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/BlingEdit-1) - This was an attempt to bring the [BlingEdit docs](https://blingedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) up-to-date with modern versions of BlingEdit. Source repository: [rhbvkleef/BlingEdit](https://github.com/rhbvkleef/BlingEdit)
