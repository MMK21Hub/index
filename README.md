## üç¥ Forks

- [**XHAK**](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) - A fork of [XAHK](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) (apparently called Minescript now?), which was the Minecraft autoclicker AutoHotKey script commissioned by Xisumavoid. At time of forking, it looked like development had ceased. However, the original script has since had features added and new releases published, meaning that this fork is now out-of-date.
- [**notable-customizations**](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/notable-customizations) - A fork of [Notable Customizations](https://github.com/notable/notable-customizations), a list of community-made customizations to the Notable note-taking app. It includes some of my own custom CSS and shortcuts.
- [**BlingEdit-1**](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/BlingEdit-1) - This was an attempt to bring the [BlingEdit docs](https://blingedit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) up-to-date with modern versions of BlingEdit. Source repository: [rhbvkleef/BlingEdit](https://github.com/rhbvkleef/BlingEdit)
- [**FIX-MC-237986**](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/FIX-MC-237986) a fork of a simple mod by plusls that does what it says in the title. I forked it to play around with the metadata files and gain an understanding of how Fabric mods are structured.
