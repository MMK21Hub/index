## üîÆ Meta

- [MMK21Hub/index](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/index) - This repository! Contains a list of all my other repositories.

## üç¥ Forks

- [t-rex-runner-black](https://github.com/MMK21Hub/t-rex-runner-black) - A dark-themed fork of [wayou/t-rex-runner](https://github.com/wayou/t-rex-runner), which is itself extracted from [Chromium source code](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:components/neterror/resources/offline.js;l=7?q=t-rex%20package:%5Echromium$&ss=chromium).
- [XHAK](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) - A fork of [XAHK](https://github.com/histefanhere/XAHK) (apparently called Minescript now?), which was the Minecraft autoclicker AutoHotKey script commissioned by Xisumavoid. At time of forking, it looked like development had ceased. However, the original script has since had features added and new releases published, meaning that this fork is now out-of-date.
